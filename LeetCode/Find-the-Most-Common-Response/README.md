# Find the Most Common Response

Can you solve this real interview question? Find the Most Common Response - You are given a 2D string array responses where each responses[i] is an array of strings representing survey responses from the ith day.

Return the most common response across all days after removing duplicate responses within each responses[i]. If there is a tie, return the lexicographically smallest response.

 

Example 1:

Input: responses = [["good","ok","good","ok"],["ok","bad","good","ok","ok"],["good"],["bad"]]

Output: "good"

Explanation:

 * After removing duplicates within each list, responses = [["good", "ok"], ["ok", "bad", "good"], ["good"], ["bad"]].
 * "good" appears 3 times, "ok" appears 2 times, and "bad" appears 2 times.
 * Return "good" because it has the highest frequency.

Example 2:

Input: responses = [["good","ok","good"],["ok","bad"],["bad","notsure"],["great","good"]]

Output: "bad"

Explanation:

 * After removing duplicates within each list we have responses = [["good", "ok"], ["ok", "bad"], ["bad", "notsure"], ["great", "good"]].
 * "bad", "good", and "ok" each occur 2 times.
 * The output is "bad" because it is the lexicographically smallest amongst the words with the highest frequency.
