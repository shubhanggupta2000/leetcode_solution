# Queens That Can Attack the King

Can you solve this real interview question? Queens That Can Attack the King - On a 0-indexed 8 x 8 chessboard, there can be multiple black queens and one white king.

You are given a 2D integer array queens where queens[i] = [xQueeni, yQueeni] represents the position of the ith black queen on the chessboard. You are also given an integer array king of length 2 where king = [xKing, yKing] represents the position of the white king.

Return the coordinates of the black queens that can directly attack the king. You may return the answer in any order.
