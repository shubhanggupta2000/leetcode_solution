# Find the Closest Palindrome

Can you solve this real interview question? Find the Closest Palindrome - Given a string n representing an integer, return the closest integer (not including itself), which is a palindrome. If there is a tie, return the smaller one.

The closest is defined as the absolute difference minimized between two integers.

Example 1:


Input: n = "123"
Output: "121"


Example 2:


Input: n = "1"
Output: "0"
Explanation: 0 and 2 are the closest palindromes but we return the smallest which is 0.
