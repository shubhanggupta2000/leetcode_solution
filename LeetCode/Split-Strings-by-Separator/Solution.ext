Input: words = ["one.two.three","four.five","six"], separator = "."
Output: ["one","two","three","four","five","six"]
Explanation: In this example we split as follows:

"one.two.three" splits into "one", "two", "three"
"four.five" splits into "four", "five"
"six" splits into "six" 

Hence, the resulting array is ["one","two","three","four","five","six"].
