# Rearrange String to Avoid Character Pair

Can you solve this real interview question? Rearrange String to Avoid Character Pair - You are given a string s and two distinct lowercase English letters x and y.

Rearrange the characters of s to construct a new string t such that:

 * t is a permutation of s.
 * Every occurrence of y appears before every occurrence of x in t.

Return any valid string t.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "aabc", x = "a", y = "c"

Output: "cbaa"

Explanation:

The string "cbaa" is a permutation of "aabc", and every occurrence of 'c' appears before every occurrence of 'a'.

Example 2:

Input: s = "dcab", x = "d", y = "b"

Output: "cabd"

Explanation:

The string "cabd" is a permutation of "dcab", and every occurrence of 'b' appears before every occurrence of 'd'.

Example 3:

Input: s = "axe", x = "o", y = "x"

Output: "axe"

Explanation:

The string "axe" is already valid. Since 'o' does not occur in the string, the required condition is automatically satisfied.
