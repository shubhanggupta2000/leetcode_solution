# Valid Binary Strings With Cost Limit

Can you solve this real interview question? Valid Binary Strings With Cost Limit - You are given two integers n and k.

The cost of a binary string s is defined as the sum of all indices i (0-based) such that s[i] == '1'.

A binary string is considered valid if:

 * It does not contain two consecutive '1' characters.
 * Its cost is less than or equal to k.

Return a list of all valid binary strings of length n in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 3, k = 1

Output: ["000","010","100"]

Explanation:

The binary strings of length 3 without consecutive '1' characters are:

 * "000" : cost = 0
 * "100" : cost = 0
 * "010" : cost = 1
 * "001" : cost = 2
 * "101" : cost = 0 + 2 = 2

Among these, the strings with cost less than or equal to k = 1 are "000", "010" and "100".

Thus, the valid strings are ["000", "010", "100"].

Example 2:

Input: n = 1, k = 0

Output: ["0","1"]

Explanation:

The valid binary strings of length 1 are "0" and "1".

Thus the answer is ["0", "1"].
