Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], n = 4, left = 1, right = 5
Output: 13 
Explanation: All subarray sums are 1, 3, 6, 10, 2, 5, 9, 3, 7, 4. After sorting them in non-decreasing order we have the new array [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10]. The sum of the numbers from index le = 1 to ri = 5 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 13.
