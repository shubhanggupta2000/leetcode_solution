Input: nums = [5,3,2,4]
Output: 0
Explanation: We can make at most 3 moves.
In the first move, change 2 to 3. nums becomes [5,3,3,4].
In the second move, change 4 to 3. nums becomes [5,3,3,3].
In the third move, change 5 to 3. nums becomes [3,3,3,3].
After performing 3 moves, the difference between the minimum and maximum is 3 - 3 = 0.
