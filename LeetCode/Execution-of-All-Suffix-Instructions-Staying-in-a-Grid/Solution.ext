Input: n = 3, startPos = [0,1], s = "RRDDLU"
Output: [1,5,4,3,1,0]
Explanation: Starting from startPos and beginning execution from the ith instruction:
- 0th: "RRDDLU". Only one instruction "R" can be executed before it moves off the grid.
- 1st:  "RDDLU". All five instructions can be executed while it stays in the grid and ends at (1, 1).
- 2nd:   "DDLU". All four instructions can be executed while it stays in the grid and ends at (1, 0).
- 3rd:    "DLU". All three instructions can be executed while it stays in the grid and ends at (0, 0).
- 4th:     "LU". Only one instruction "L" can be executed before it moves off the grid.
- 5th:      "U". If moving up, it would move off the grid.
