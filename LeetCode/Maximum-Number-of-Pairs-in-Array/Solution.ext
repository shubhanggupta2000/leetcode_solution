Input: nums = [1,3,2,1,3,2,2]
Output: [3,1]
Explanation:
Form a pair with nums[0] and nums[3] and remove them from nums. Now, nums = [3,2,3,2,2].
Form a pair with nums[0] and nums[2] and remove them from nums. Now, nums = [2,2,2].
Form a pair with nums[0] and nums[1] and remove them from nums. Now, nums = [2].
No more pairs can be formed. A total of 3 pairs have been formed, and there is 1 number leftover in nums.
