# Minimum Moves to Equal Array Elements III

Can you solve this real interview question? Minimum Moves to Equal Array Elements III - You are given an integer array nums.

In one move, you may increase the value of any single element nums[i] by 1.

Return the minimum total number of moves required so that all elements in nums become equal.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,1,3]

Output: 3

Explanation:

To make all elements equal:

 * Increase nums[0] = 2 by 1 to make it 3.
 * Increase nums[1] = 1 by 1 to make it 2.
 * Increase nums[1] = 2 by 1 to make it 3.

Now, all elements of nums are equal to 3. The minimum total moves is 3.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,4,5]

Output: 2

Explanation:

To make all elements equal:

 * Increase nums[0] = 4 by 1 to make it 5.
 * Increase nums[1] = 4 by 1 to make it 5.

Now, all elements of nums are equal to 5. The minimum total moves is 2.
